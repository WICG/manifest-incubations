# Scope Extensions for Web Apps

## Overview

This document describes a new `scope_extensions` manifest member that enables
web apps to extend their
[scope](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#understanding-scope) to other
origins.


## Use Cases / Goals

- Allow sites that control multiple subdomains and top level domains to behave
  as one contiguous web app.\
  E.g. a site may span `example.com`, `example.co.uk` and `support.example.com`.

- Allow web apps to capture user navigations to sites they are affiliated with.\
  E.g. "News Aggregator App" capturing links navigations to examplenewssite.com.


## Background

Web app scope (defined by the `scope` field) is currently used for:
1. Determining whether an app window's root document has left the app's scope
   (possibly invoking window UI informing the user of this).
1. Constraining URLs appearing in manifest members like `start_url`, `file_handlers`, or `share_target`.

The `scope_extensions` mechanism can expand all these behaviours to include
other origins given agreement between the web app's primary origin and the
associated origins.


## Proposal

1. Add a `scope_extensions` member to the web app manifest specifying a list of
   origin patterns to associate with.

   Example manifest located at `https://example.com/manifest.webmanifest`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "",
     "name": "Example",
     "display": "standalone",
     "start_url": "/index.html",
     "scope_extensions": [
       {"origin": "*.example.com"},
       {"origin": "example.co.uk"},
       {"origin": "*.example.co.uk"}
     ]
   }
   ```
   In this example the "Example" app is extending its app scope to all its
   subdomains along with its `.co.uk` site and its subdomains.

1. Specify a `web-app-origin-association.json` file format that must be located
   at `https://<associated origin>/.well-known/web-app-origin-association.json`
   on the associated origin's domain. This specifies the set of web apps that
   may include it as a scope extension keyed on each web app's identifier.

   Example association file located at
   `https://example.co.uk/.well-known/web-app-origin-association.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "web_apps": {
        "https://example.com/": {
          "scope": "/",
          "authorize": ["intercept-links"]
        },
        "https://associated.site.com/": {
          "scope": "/",
        }
      }
    }
   ```

1. Let the extended scope be the set of URLs that:
    - Has an origin that matches one of the origin patterns in the manifest's
      `scope_extensions` list.
    - Has an origin with a valid
      `<origin>/.well-known/web-app-origin-association.json` association file
      with an association entry keyed by the web app's identifier.
    - Matches a `scope` entry in the association entry. This entry behaves 
      similarly to the `scope` field in the web app manifest spec.

1. Replace the constraint on manifest URLs that are bound by scope (except for
   `start_url`) to instead be bound by the extended scope. Validation of the
   associated origins is not required for these URLs to be part of a valid
   manifest. Prior to validation the URLs must be treated as if they were not
   specified.


## Security Considerations

### Declarative link capturing events

Capturing user navigations via `"capture_links": "existing-client-event"` has
the potential for the web app to spoof its associated origins. Event link
capturing must not be supported for associated origins unless they specify
`"authorize": ["intercept-links"]` in their entry for the associated web app.
This opt-in is used as a signal of trust between the associated origin and the
web app.


## Related Proposals

### [URL Handlers](https://github.com/WICG/pwa-url-handler/blob/main/explainer.md)

The Scope Extensions proposal is intended to be a replacement for the
[URL Handlers](https://github.com/WICG/pwa-url-handler/blob/main/explainer.md)
proposal with the following changes:
 - Re-orient the goal to be focused just on expanding the set of origins/URLs in
   the web app's scope. Remove the goal of registering web apps as URL handlers
   in the user's operating system. That behaviour will be covered by the
   [Declarative Link Capturing](https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch/blob/main/declarative_link_capturing.md)
   proposal instead.
 - Rename the new manifest field from `url_handlers` to `scope_extensions` to
   reflect the change in goals.
 - Move the association file from "<origin>/web-app-origin-association.json" to
   "<origin>/.well-known/web-app-origin-association.json". This better conforms
   with [RFC 8615](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615).
 - Change the association file entries to be keyed on the web app identifier
   rather than the web app's manifest URL. This aligns with the recent
   [PWA Unique ID](https://github.com/philloooo/pwa-unique-id/blob/main/explainer.md)
   proposal.
 - Rename `"paths"` to `"include_paths"` in the association file entries.
 - Add an "authorize" field to the association file entries for the associated
   origin to provide explicit opt-in signals for security sensitive
   capabilities.

### [Declarative Link Capturing](https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch/blob/main/declarative_link_capturing.md)

Scope extensions can be considered the first stage in the link capturing
pipeline. This proposal allows developers to control the set of user navigation
URLs that the web app is intended to capture. The
[Declarative Link Capturing](https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch/blob/main/declarative_link_capturing.md)
proposal allows developers to control the action that is taken once a user
navigation is captured e.g. open a new app context or navigate an existing one.
