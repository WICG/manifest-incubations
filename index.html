        <code>display_override</code> member
      </h2>
      <p>
        For advanced usages, the display_override member can be used to specify
        a custom fallback order of <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest#dfn-display-modes-values">display mode values</a> for
        developers to choose their preferred <a data-cite=

      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>display_override</dfn> member of the [=application manifest=]
        is a <a>sequence</a> of <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest#dfn-display-modes-values">display mode values</a>. This
        item represents the developer's preferred fallback chain for
        <a data-cite="appmanifest#dfn-display-mode">display modes</a>. This
        field overrides the [=manifest/display=] member. If the user agent does
        not support any of the display modes specified here, then it falls back
        to considering the [=manifest/display=] member. See <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest#dfn-display-mode">display modes</a> for the algorithm
        steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following steps are added to the [=application manifest/processing
        extension-point=] in <a data-cite=

      <p class="note">
        This member is intended to be only used for advanced cases, where the
        developer wants explicit control over the fallback order of their
        display modes. Otherwise, the [=manifest/display=] member is sufficient
        for most use cases.

        <p>
          Depending on the operating system capabilities, the protocol handler
          could become a 'default' handler (e.g. handling launches of a given
          protocol automatically) of a given protocol without the explicit
          knowledge of the user. To protect against possible misuse, user
          agents MAY employ protections such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requiring explicit user consent before executing the process to
          [=invoke a protocol handler=].
          </li>
          <li>Removing the web application's OS registration as a protocol
          handling entity, either in response to the above dialog or by user
          action.
          </li>
          <li>Confirming protocol handler registrations on [=installation=].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a user agent removes the the registration of the protocol handler
          entity it SHOULD provide UX for the user to re-register the web app
          and protocol with the operating system.

      <h2>
        Manifest override objects
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each <dfn>manifest override object</dfn> is a generic object value
        that allows for certain manifest properties to be overridden within
        a particular context.
      </p>
      <p>The structure of a [=manifest override object=] is as follows:</p>
      <pre class="json">
        {
          "context_key": {
            "property": "new value"
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        Each manifest property that accepts a [=manifest override object=]
        as its value will define the contexts it supports and which
        properties it supports overriding. User agents MUST ignore any contexts
        that are not supported by the property as well as any override
        properties not explicitly allowed within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the manifest property’s context is applicable, the value of each
        allowable override will be used in place of the original value defined
        in the Manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redefined array items will be overridden in the order they are authored.
        When redefining objects (e.g., [=manifest/shortcuts=], [=manifest/icons=]),
        authors will only be able to redefine specific properties of that object.
        In order to ensure all overrides are applied correctly, the order must
        match the original array (i.e., each [=manifest/shortcut=] must be redefined
        in order, as must their icons, if they also require re-definition).
      </p>
        Redefined array items must also be equal in number to the array being
        overridden. If there is a mismatch in the number of items in either array,
        any excess items will be ignored. This is only an issue if the original
        array has more items than the override array, because any excess items
        within the original array will not be re-defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is a conflict because two different properties are attempting
        to override the same value in their respective active contexts, the one
        defined last will win. By way of example, consider the following:
      </p>
      <pre class="json">
        {
          "lang": "en-US",
          "icons": [
            {
              "src": "icon.png",
              "sizes": "128x128",
              "type": "image/png"
            }
          ],
          "translations": {
            "es": {
              "icons": [
                {
                  "src": "icon-es.png"
                }
              ]
            }
          },
          "user_preferences": {
            "color_scheme": {
              "dark": {
                "icons": [
                  {
                    "src": "icon-dark.png"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, if the user’s primary language is Español, but 
        their preferred color scheme was set to "dark", the icon supplied 
        would be the dark version and not the localized one. For this reason,
        it is imperative that properties taking a [=manifest override object=]
        as their value consider whether any other properties that also enable
        overrides should be able to be redefined within them. In the above
        example, the author’s intent would likely have been better realized
        if `user_preferences` was put before `translations` and the localized
        context block redefined the `user_preferences` value for that language:

              "sizes": "128x128",

          Installability signals
        </h3>
        <p>
          By design, this specification does not provide developers with an
          explicit API to "install" a web application. Instead, a
          <a>manifest</a> can serve as an <dfn>installability signal</dfn> to a
          user agent that a web application can be installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of <a>installability signals</a> for a web application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>has a [=application manifest=] with an application name and a
          suitable icon.
          </li>
          <li>is served over a secure network connection, but also functions
          without a network connection.
          </li>
          <li>has a sensible content security policy.
          </li>
          <li>is able to responsively adapt to display on a variety of screen
          sizes, catering for both mobile and desktop.
          </li>
          <li>shows a high degree of end-user engagement over an extended
          period of time.
          </li>
          <li>has been explicitly marked by the user as one that they value and
          trust (e.g., by bookmarking or "starring" it).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This list is not exhaustive and some <a>installability signals</a>
          might not apply to all user agents. How a user agent makes use of
          these <a>installability signals</a> to determine if a web application
          can be installed is left to implementers.

        <div class="note">
          The <a>beforeinstallprompt</a> event is somewhat misnamed, as it does
          not necessarily signal that a <a>manual installation</a> will follow
          (depending on the user agent, it might just be giving the site the
          ability to trigger an install prompt). It is so named for historical
          reasons.
        </div>
        <pre class="idl" data-cite="DOM">

          dictionary PromptResponseObject {

        <p>
          The {{BeforeInstallPromptEvent}} is dispatched when the site is
          allowed to present a <a>site-triggered install prompt</a>, or prior
          to the user agent presenting an <a>automated install prompt</a>. It
          allows the site to cancel the <a>automated install prompt</a>, as
          well as manually present the <a>site-triggered install prompt</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          If the {{BeforeInstallPromptEvent}} is <em>not</em> cancelled, the
          user agent is allowed to <a>present an install prompt</a>
          (specifically, an <a>automated install prompt</a>) to the end-user.
          Canceling the default action (via {{Event/preventDefault()}})
          prevents the user agent from <a>presenting an install prompt</a>. The
          user agent is free to run <a>steps to notify that an install prompt
          is available</a> again at a later time.

          The <dfn>PromptResponseObject</dfn> contains the result of calling

            A boolean, initially `false`. Represents whether this event was

            <a>site-triggered install prompt</a>. In this way, the site can
            leave installation at the user's discretion (rather than prompting
            at an arbitrary time), whilst still providing a prominent UI to do
            so.
